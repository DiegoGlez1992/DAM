BUG FIXES IN THIS RELEASE

- Bug 4984867 - Confusing documemtation issue on packaging the helpset with
  the helpset or mapfile outside the Jar file removed.

- Bug 4944565 - Duplicate images on Windows. Updated the names of the images 
  for consistency on Windows platforms. Provided support for images in the
  UIManager Table.

- Added missing nonavigator.jsp to the server demo.

- Added support for Polish locale.

- Bug 5044936 - HelpSet.getCombinedMap was not recursive through subhelpsets.

- Bug 5057152 - Null Pointer Exception was thrown when mergeing Helpsets
  when there was no name.

- Bug 5056158 - The default presentation was not used when the HelpBroker
  was created. Added a JHelp.setHelpSetPresentation(HelpSet.Presentation)
  method and updated the demos to use the default presentation.

- Bug 5107221 - Intial startup was slow. The data for navigators was being
  loaded in the event thread. They are now loaded in a lower priority thread
  resulting in a faster startup time.

- Bug 4949896 - Errors in Czech and Slovak Constants corrected.

- Bug 4942062 - Fixed IllegalArgumentException: argument is null when
  adding a favorite node after restarting an application thas has some
  favorites recorded in the user's favorites file.

- Bug 6175340 - JavaHelp could be displayed on multiheaded machines.


BUG FIXES IN THE 2.0_01 RELEASE

- Bug 4923782 - SortMerge was not handling a dataless master navigator
  (a master navigator with no elements) correctly. The symptom was that
  the navigator being merged had nothing in it after the sort merge. This
  bug has been fixed. Now, when a sort merge is performed, a subhelpset
  navigator can populate a master navigator with data. One effect of this
  fix is that a subhelpset can add new master elements, and merges of
  subsequent subhelpsets with matching elements will then have those
  elements merged into these new master elements as though the new
  elements were originally part of the master helpset.

- Bug 4924174 - WindowPresentation.setSize not working on dialogs. The
  symptom was that calling HelpBroker.setSize had no effect on the size
  of the help window. Now setting the size of the presentation works in
  all cases.

- Bug 4927588 - Search on statically merged helpsets was working only for
  the master helpset. Now search works for all helpsets statically merged
  into a helpset.

- Bug 4932737 - FavoritesAction in ApiDemo throws null pointer exception.
  The NPE was thrown because the BasicFavoritesNavigator class stored the
  last HelpEventModel, which in some cases didn't exist. This class has
  been changed to use the currentID and currentURL from the HelpModel
  instead. 

  There was an additional request in this bug report to add a Favorites
  button to IdeDemo. IdeDemo doesn't require a Favorites button because
  the user can add a Favorites item by right-clicking the mouse inside
  the Favorites navigator.

- Bug 4932740 - JavaHelp System User's Guide incorrectly states that 
  a Favorites button is automatically added to the toolbar of the help 
  viewer when you define a Favorites section in the helpset file. This
  statement was partially correct: a Favorites button is automatically
  added to the  default help viewer. However, if you define your own
  presentations in the helpset file, you must add a help action for the
  favorites button to the toolbar section. See the updated JUHG section 
  "Favorites Navigator and File" for more information.

- Bug 4933236 - Presentation toolbar and navigators ignored in
  SecondaryWindows. This bug has been fixed. Secondary windows defined as
  presentations in the helpset file now can display navigators and
  a toolbar. As described in the "Helpset File" section of the "JavaHelp
  User's Guide", if you want only the topic pane to display for a secondary
  window (no navigators), you must use the displayviews="false" attribute
  when you define the presentation because the navigators display by 
  default. To get a toolbar to display, you must define one with the
  <toolbar> tag.

- Bug 4933497 - Can't print from Favorites navigator. This bug has been
  fixed. You can now print any selected items in the Favorites navigator.

- Bug 4933965 - The Windows print dialog allows printing of up to 9999
  blank pages on successive prints of JavaHelp topics. This bug has
  been fixed.

- Bug 4934582 - Selecting a TOC item that has an alternate presentation
  defined in the helpset file causes JavaHelp to hang. This bug has been
  fixed.

- Bug 4934908 - Can't add a favorites from search if SearchItem URL
  isn't in map file. The fix was to properly identify the help set name
  and URL if a matching ID wasn't found in the helpset file.

- Bug 4936341 - When adding a favorite item the deep copy of a 
  FavoritesNode causes a null value to be created for a child, 
  which in turns causes an IllegalArgumentException to be thrown. Fixed
  in this release - it's now possible to add a an item to the Favorites
  navigator without causing exceptions.


BUG FIXES IN THE 2.0 RELEASE

- Bugs 4148736 and 4884507 - No control over TOC and index nodes' initial
  state - would like to be able to display these navigators with nodes
  expanded or collapsed. Version 2.0 makes it possible to specify in the
  TOC and index files whether or not nodes initially display in an
  expanded or collapsed state. Additionally new collapseID() and
  expandID() methods have been added to JHelpTOCNavigator and
  JHelpIndexNavigator.

- Bug 4182971 - <homeID> topic should be highlighted in TOC. The home topic
  is now highlighted in the TOC or index when the help set first opens.

- Bug 4228385 - InstallAnywhere fails with Solaris Group JVM (Java 2).
  We are no longer using InstallAnywhere to install JavaHelp.

- Bug 4228425 - InstallAnywhere license and info panes sometimes blank
  (Solaris CDE). We are no longer using InstallAnywhere to install JavaHelp.

- Bug 4235715 - Can't get context sensitive help ID for content of component.
  The problem reported was a 2D editing component that was the bulk of a
  user interface. Users wanted to have context sensitive help for the
  elements within the 2D editing component. There was no way to get the
  MouseEvent of the user's click from CSH.trackCSEvents. 

  The solution was to create a new set of methods in the CSH class and a new
  interface named CSH.Manager. There is an explanation in the JavaHelp
  System User's Guide (section 5.3.4 "Dynamic Map ID Assignment") of how to
  use the CSH methods and CSH.Manager to assign help IDs dynamically.

- Bug 4295269 - Content pane does not load document the first time the help
  set is viewed. The content viewer was not being properly initialized to
  the current ID on creation of the viewer. This bug has been fixed.

- Bug 4276012 - Search highlighting off in some cases. Search highlighting
  is now correctly synchronized with the help viewer.

- Bug 4375554 - Internal style sheets throw off search highlighting. Search
  highlighting is now correctly synchronized.

- Bug 4459055 - Indexer can't index more than 500 documents on Solaris.
  This bug was fixed by calling in.close() in Index.java when done with
  an InputStream.

- Bug 4463539 - HelpModel.setCurrentURL doesn't work when currentURL is null.
  This method was passing a null URL. It now works correctly.

- Bug 4478631 - When running in ja locale, the tooltips for 'page setup',
  'Contents', 'Index' and 'Search' are shown in English. These tooltips now
  display in Japanese if the locale is ja.

- Bug 4484945 - TOC and Index not highlighting topic if reference (anchor)
  is clicked in ContentViewer. The TOC and Index navigators track the topics
  in the content pane of the help viewer. They do so by highlighting the
  corresponding entry in the navigator when the user opens a topic that is in
  the helpset. More precisely, they track map IDs of topics. Prior to this
  fix, if the link went to an anchor that did not have a map ID defined for
  it, the tracking didn't work. Now the tracking does work: It finds the map
  ID of the main file.

- Bug 4486379 - HelpViewer window's size gets reset whenever it is invoked
  to show help. The fix was to add a setSize method to MainWindow. This
  method determines first if the dialog or frame exists and then passes their
  values back in getSize rather than the default sizes. If the dialog or
  frame doesn't exist the defaults are returned.

- Bug 4635290 - Errors in search engines in help sets can cause VM to
  abruptly exit. The fix was to remove the call to System.exit. The original 
  problem was caused by the user's incorrectly specifying the search engine
  in the helpset file. Thus, even with this fix, search won't work if the
  search engine isn't specified correctly, but now the error doesn't cause
  the JVM to exit.

- Bug 4680140 - xml:lang tag doesn't parse locale strings correctly. The
  problem was that the parser couldn't handle the "-" character. Now it does.

- Bug 4690618 - SecondaryViewer memory leaks and out of memory errors.
  Secondary windows were complete rewritten in version 2.0 and now do not
  exhibit any memory leaks.

- Bug 4696361 - Print dialog does not come up when using JavaHelp with JDK
  1.4. Fixed in version 2.0.

- Bug 4736708 - Search results display truncates some results in JavaHelp
  1.1.3. This bug was fixed in version 2.0.

- Bug 4747558 - JavaHelp User's Guide PDF version doesn't have images. Using
  a different PDF generator has enabled images to be produced for the PDF
  version of the user's guide.

- Bug 4768427 - Printing from JavaHelp causes a freeze. The freeze was
  happening with very small help topics. It has been fixed.

- Bug 4788532 - BasicSearchCellRenderer throws a NullPointerException when
  the title member is null, and the help viewer fails to load and paint.
  The fix was to not make the call if the title is null. 

- Bug 4789016 - JavaHelp is not threadsafe on a multiprocessor machine. The
  problem was caused by incorrect usage of Thread.stop() in the search engine.
  The fix was to completely rewrite the code in the search engine.

- Bug 4845876 - French translation error: JavaHelp is translating the tooltip
  tip.pageSetup as 'Lise en page', but the translation should be 
  'Mise en page'. This translation error was fixed.

- Bug 4859304 - DefaultHelpBroker.setHelpSet doesn't work as expected. The
  reported problem was with two help sets called programmatically as follows:

  a) Create a DefaultHelpBroker by calling its default constructor.
  b) Assign the helpset using DefaultHelpBroker.setHelpSet().

  In JavaHelp 1.1.3:
  - Calling DefaultHelpBroker.setHelpSet(a), worked as expected.
  - Calling DefaultHelpBroker.setHelpSet(b), did display b's TOC, but the
    content pane was still using the page from helpset a.

  In JavaHelp 2.0, calling DefaultHelpBroker.setHelpSet(b) had no effect
  at all. It still displayed a's TOC.

  The V2.0 bug was fixed. If you want the content pane to change when you
  switch back and forth between helpsets, either you must set the currentID,
  or you need to have a homeID set for the helpset to which you switch.
  Either technique will correctly display a page from the current helpset. 

- Bug 4890962 - The first time context sensitive help is activated, it shows
  the home page, rather than the page associated with the helpID.
  Specifically, after calling CSH.DisplayHelpAfterTracking, the first time
  the actionPerformed method was called, the help window displayed the home
  page rather than the context-sensitive topic in the content pane. This bug
  was fixed, and now the context-sensitive page displays as expected.

- Bug 4910723 - DefaultHelpBroker.setSize(Dimension) and setLocation(Point)
  don't work. The helpset could not be resized or moved with these two
  methods. These methods are now working.

- Bug 4910769 - After starting the application, the first time that
  setHelpID() was called the JavaHelp browser opened but always showed the
  default topic defined for the helpset. After the first time the call
  worked properly. This bug was fixed, and the first call to setHelpID()
  now displays the topic associated with the helpID.


CHANGE TO API FOR ACCESSING FRAMES

In previous versions of JavaHelp, you could access the frame
in whichJavaHelp is displayed directly if you extended the 
DefaultHelpBroker. After extending DefaultHelpBroker, you 
were able access the protected JFrame frame field. 
 
In JavaHelp 2, the frame field is no longer accessible. In
applications that use JavaHelp 2, you have to rewrite code 
that does this kind of frame access. Use the following methods:

   WindowPresentation DefaultHelpBroker.getWindowPresentation(); 
   Window WindowPresentation.getHelpWindow();

You will still be able to access the frame with the following method
calls:

   WindowPresentation pres = hb.getWindowPresentation(); 
   Window win = pres.getHelpWindow();

FILE SEPARATORS FOR WIN32 PLATFORMS

All files in the JavaHelp system are specified as URLs.  The
separator between elements (files) in a hierarchy should be "/".
In some cases "\" works on the Win32 platforms; however when the
files that contain these references are added to JAR files or moved
to different platforms, these references no longer work.
TARGET AUDIENCE

JavaHelp software is intended for help authors, information
architects, and software developers who need a framework for
delivering online help and documentation.

GETTING STARTED

You install JavaHelp software by extracting the zip file. While most
installations will not require any additional installation tasks,
some installations might require that the environment variable JAVAHELP_HOME
be defined so that jhindexer and jhsearch will work correctly. You will
know that you need to set JAVAHELP_HOME if, after installation, you see
an error from jhindexer or jhsearch indicating that the environment
variable needs to be set.
