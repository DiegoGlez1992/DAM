<h2>JavaHelp System Features</h2>
<p>This section describes the main features of the JavaHelp system. For a list of new features in this release, see <a href="../release/changes.html">New Features in JavaHelp 2.0</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="helpviewers">Help Viewers</a></h3>
<p>There are three types of windows in which you can display your help topics. 
  These windows can be specified in the Java program when it makes a call to the 
  help system. The help author can set various attributes of these windows in 
  the helpset (<code>.hs</code>) file. These windows cannot be invoked from a link 
  in a help topic (although there is a way to link to a popup window that uses 
  a different technique, described in <a href="../author/popup.html">Opening Popup 
  and Secondary Windows From an HTML Topic</a>). However, it is possible to open 
  a topic in one of these windows from the table of contents in the tri-paned 
  viewer (see the Presentation feature in <a href="../author/helpset.html#presentationtag">Helpset 
  File</a>,  the  <code>presentationtype</code> and <code>presentationname</code> descriptions in the sections on the <a href="../author/toc.html">TOC</a>, <a href="../author/index.html">index</a>, and <a href="../author/glossary.html">glossary</a> navigators, and the section  <a href="../dev/csh.html#presentation">Implementing Context-Sensitive 
  Help</a>.
</p>
<p>The windows are:</p>
<ul type="circle">
  
<li>Main window (by default, a tri-paned help viewer)</li>
  <li>Secondary window</li>
  <li>Popup window</li>
</ul>
<h4>Main Window</h4>
<p> The standard JavaHelp system main window has three panes, is not destroyed 
  when you exit the window, and is configurable (see the presentation feature 
  in <a href="../author/helpset.html#presentationtag">Helpset File</a>). By default, 
  a main window has the following three panes: 
<table width=98% border=0 cellpadding=5>
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td width="15%" nowrap>Toolbar</td>
    <td width="85%"> A bar over the navigation and content panes that can be configured 
      to display various toolbar buttons, such as Back, Forward, and Print. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td width="15%" nowrap>Navigation pane </td>
    <td width="85%"> A tabbed interface appearing on the left that allows users 
      to switch between the table of contents, index, and full text search displays. 
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td width=15% nowrap>Content pane </td>
    <td width=85%> A pane on the right that displays help topics formatted with 
      HTML 3.2 or later, plus embedded <a href="../dev/lwcomp.html">lightweight 
      Java components</a>. </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The following figure shows a help window with a toolbar that has three buttons 
  in it, a table of contents in the navigation pane on the left, and in the content 
  pane, a help topic, &quot;Debugging in the Source Editor&quot;:</p>
<p align="center"> <img alt="Help Viewer Window" src="../images/overview/viewer.gif"> 
</p>
<h4 align="left">Secondary Window</h4>
<p align="left">By default, this window contains a single pane, a help content 
  viewer that shows a help topic. It is similar to the content pane of the tri-paned 
  viewer. A secondary window has a name and can be configured to have a navigation 
  pane and a toolbar. If the window is already open, its contents are replaced 
  if the Java program uses it again. When the user closes a secondary window, 
  it is destroyed (unlike the main window, which is not destroyed on exit).</p>
<h4 align="left">Popup Window</h4>
<p align="left">This type of window stays open as long as it has focus. When the 
  user clicks elsewhere, the window is destroyed. A popup has only one pane, a 
  content viewer.</p>
<h3>Table of Contents</h3>
<p> Provides a collapsible and expandable display of topics in the help system. Supports unlimited 
  levels and merging of multiple TOCs. The underlying file format follows World 
  Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Extended Markup Language (XML) standards. The TOC 
  display is synchronized with the content viewer: The topic being displayed is 
  highlighted in the TOC. For more information, see <a href="../author/toc.html">Table of Contents File</a>.
<h3>Index</h3>
<p> Supports merging of multiple indexes. The underlying file format follows W3C 
  XML standards. The index display is synchronized with the content viewer: The 
  topic being displayed is highlighted in the index. For more information, see <a href="../author/index.html">Index File</a>.
<h3>Full-Text Search</h3>
<p>
The  full-text search engine can be used in a
variety of network environments.  Matches returned from
searches are ranked for relevancy by using "relaxation
rules."
For more information, see <a href="../author/search.html">Full-Text Search</a>.
<h3>Compression and Encapsulation</h3>
<p>
The standard JAR format is used to encapsulate the
help information into a single, compressed file.  The
JavaHelp system works equally well with help information
that is not compressed into JAR files - this flexibility allows authors
to view files during development without taking the time to
compress them.

<h3>Embeddable Help Windows</h3>
<p>
Help windows (individually or in combination) can be embedded directly
into application interfaces. 

<h3>Context-Sensitive Help</h3>
<p> Help can be activated from Java programs through a number of different mechanisms. For more information, see the help authoring section <a href="../author/csh.html"> Context-Sensitive Help</a> and the Java developer section <a href="../dev/csh.html">Implementing Context-Sensitive Help</a>.
<h3>Flexible Packaging</h3>
<p>
Flexible packaging of help information for product delivery
makes it easy to incrementally update help information in
the field.

<h3>Customization</h3>
<p>
The JavaHelp system is designed to permit great flexibility
in customizing both the user interface and functionality.

<h3>Merging</h3>
<p>
Help information from different sources can be combined and
presented to the end user.
For more information, see <a href="../author/merge.html">Merging 
  Helpsets</a>. 

<h3>JavaBeans Support</h3>
<p>
The JavaHelp API enables a JavaBeans component to specify
help information that can be presented to the end
user (perhaps merged with additional information).
