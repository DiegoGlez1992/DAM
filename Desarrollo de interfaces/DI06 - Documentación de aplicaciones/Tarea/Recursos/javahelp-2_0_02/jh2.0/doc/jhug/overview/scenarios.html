<h2>Descriptive Scenarios</h2>
<p>
The following scenarios illustrate some of the many
ways the JavaHelp system can be used to provide online help
for different types of Java programs in a variety of
network environments.  These scenarios attempt to
illustrate the JavaHelp system's flexibility and extensibility.
<p>
Scenarios are presented in three areas:

    <td width=75%> Scenarios that describe different ways that the JavaHelp system 
      can be invoked from applications. </td>
