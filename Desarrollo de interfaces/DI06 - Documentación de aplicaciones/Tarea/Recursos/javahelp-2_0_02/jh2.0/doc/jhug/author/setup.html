<h2>Setting Up Your JavaHelp Project</h2>
<p> There are two primary things to consider when you set up your help projects: 
<ul type="circle">
<li>How best to organize help information files to
organize them logically and conveniently for
<i>authoring</i></li>
<li>How to organize help information to best
<i>package</i> it for delivery to your users.</li> 
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>Authoring</h3>
<p> The JavaHelp system is <i>file-</i><i>based </i>- topics are contained in 
  files that are displayed in the help viewer one file at a time. It is a good 
  idea to group related topics together to keep them organized and to make it 
  as easy as possible to link the topics together. <br>
  <br>
</p>
<table border=0 cellpadding=0>
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td width=2%><img src="../images/hg_note.gif" width="18" height="13" align="bottom">&nbsp;</td>
    <td width=98%> The JavaHelp system uses URLs. A URL can resolve to the contents 
      of a file in a file system, a file on the web, or a portion of a JAR file, 
      or it can even be generated dynamically by a server. </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p> You might also consider organizing topics to make it easy to package them 
  into a compressed <a
href="jar.html">JAR file</a> for delivery to your users. </p>
<p> For both these reasons, it is usually best to organize your topics in a folder 
  hierarchy that you can "tear off" and place in the JAR file. </p>
<p>
The following diagram shows such a hierarchy:
</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="../images/topic_filesystem.gif" width="374" height="252">
</p>

<h4>Links</h4>
<p> The destination of a link to another topic in the helpst should be specified 
  <i>relative</i> to the file that contains the link. The following is an example 
  of such a relative link: 
<pre>   &lt;A HREF="../subtopicB/topic.html"&gt;new topic&lt;/A&gt;</pre>
Do not specify links to other topics by using an absolute link. For example, the 
following link uses a full path name to the destination of the link: 
<pre>   &lt;A HREF="C:/product/help/subtopicB/topic.html"&gt;new topic&lt;/A&gt;</pre>
<p> Only relative links remain valid when the topic hierarchy is packaged into 
  a JAR file and then installed on the user's computer.
<h4><a name="separators">File Separators ("/" vs. "\")</a> </h4>
<p> All files in a JavaHelp system are specified as URLs, which use the forward 
  slash ("/") as the separator between elements (files) in a hierarchy. Although 
  in some cases a backslash ("\") works on Windows platforms, if files that contain 
  such references are installed on a different platform, the references no longer 
  work. 
<h3>Packaging</h3>
<p>
In addition to the topic files, the help information
includes <i>metadata</i> files that contain information
about the help system.  Where you locate these metadata
files can affect how you package, deliver, and update the
help information for your users.
</p><p>
In JavaHelp systems there are two kinds of metadata:
<ul type="circle">
<li><a href="#nav_data">Navigational data</a></li>
<li><a href="#hs_data">Helpset data</a></li>
</ul>


<h4><a name="nav_data">Navigational Data</a></h4>
<p>
Navigational data files contain information that is used
by the JavaHelp system navigators.  The standard JavaHelp
system navigators are:
<ul type="circle">
  <li><a href="toc.html">Table of contents</a></li>
  <li><a href="index.html">Index</a></li>
  <li><a href="search.html">Full-text search</a></li>
  <li><a href="glossary.html">Glossary</a></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p> Each of these navigators has a metadata file associated with it that contains 
  navigational data. These metadata files should be located in close proximity 
  to the topic files to make it easier to package them into <a href="jar.html">JAR 
  files</a> with the topic files for delivery to customers. The following diagram 
  displays an example. </p>
<p align="center">
<img src="../images/meta_filesystem.gif"  width="373" height="330">
</p>


<h4><a name="hs_data">Helpset Data</a></h4>
<p>
Helpset data is information that the JavaHelp system needs to
run your help system.  It is contained in two files:
<ul type="circle">
<li><a href="helpset.html">Helpset file</a></li>
<li><a href="map.html">Map file</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
When the JavaHelp system is activated by your application,
the first thing it does is read the <a
href="helpset.html">helpset file</a>.  The helpset file
contains all the information needed to
run the help system. As you can imagine, your application
must be able to find the helpset file after the product is
installed on your user's system.
</p><p>
The helpset file contains the location of the <a
href="map.html">map file</a> and in most cases, the map
file is read when the <a href="helpset.html">helpset</a> is
initialized.  The map file is used to associate topic IDs
with URLs (paths to HTML topic files).
</p>
<p>
The following diagram shows how a help hierarchy might be
set up to include the helpset file and map file.
</p>
<p align="center"> <img src="../images/full_filesystem.gif" width="370" height="344"></p>

<h3><a name="jar">Packaging a Helpset into a JAR File</a></h3>
<p> You can package your help information into JAR files for delivery to your 
  users. Usually, you package the helpset file and map file in the JAR file along 
  with the topic files and navigational files. 
<p> On the Java<sup><font size="1">TM</font></sup> 2 Platform, the <code>jar:</code> 
  protocol makes various packaging options available. Including the helpset and 
  map files in or or excluding them from the JAR file has an effect on how you 
  deliver the help information and how you can later update it. The following 
  two sections describe some of the issues to consider when making that decision. 
<p>
<h4>Helpset File</h4>
<p>
Under some installation conditions, the helpset file could be
excluded from the JAR file, while the map file is included.
The following diagram illustrates this arrangement:
</p> 
<p align="center">
<img src="../../images/map1.gif" width="448" height="438">
</p>
<p> Note that the map file is referenced with the <a
href="jar.html#jarprotocol"><code>jar:</code> protocol</a>. </p>
<p> The helpset file is the only help system file referenced explicitly by the 
  application. The JavaHelp system derives all information about the help system 
  from that file. If the helpset file is outside the JAR file, the installation 
  program can update the helpset file so the JAR files can be installed anywhere 
  in the user's file system. This is not possible if the helpset file is included 
  in the JAR file. </p>
<p>
Another advantage of locating the helpset file outside 
the JAR file is that it can be updated independently of the
rest of the helpset.  For example, additional help information
can be added to the user's help system by adding more JAR files
and updating the helpset file.
</p>

<h4><a name="map_jar">Map File</a></h4>
<p> Excluding the map file from the JAR file is possible, but is usually not useful. 
</p>

<img src="../../images/map3.gif" width="499" height="465">
</center>
<p>
If the map file is located outside of the JAR file, all URLs
in the map must use the <code>jar:</code> protocol.  For
example:
</p>
<pre>jar:file:/c:/product/help/Ajar.jar!/File1.html</pre>
