<h1>Authoring Help Information</h1>
<p> The topics in this chapter of the <i>JavaHelp System User's Guide</i> describe 
  the aspects of the JavaHelp software that are of primary interest to online 
  help authors. These topics assume that the author is responsible for creating 
  the metadata files that the JavaHelp software uses to present information, as 
  well as the topics that inform the application's users. Together the metadata 
  and topic files are referred to as a <i>helpset</i>. 
<table width="95%">
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td nowrap width="2%"><img src="../../images/hg_note.gif" width="18" height="13">&nbsp; 
    <td width="98%">If you use a help authoring tool to create your help system, 
      some of the details described in this chapter are managed for you by the 
      tool. 
  </table>
<p> The following list summarizes the tasks required to create a helpset. All 
  these tasks are described in this chapter of the <i>JavaHelp System User's Guide</i>: 
<ul type="circle">
<li>Create HTML topics
<li>Create a helpset file
<li>Create a map file
<li>Create a table of contents file
<li>Create an index file
<li>Create a full-text search database
<li>Compress and encapsulate the help files into a JAR
file for delivery to customers
</ul>
<p>
Consider the following strategy as a way to
get started:
<ol>
  <li>Use the <a href="../release/demos.html">demonstration programs</a> included 
    with the release to acquaint yourself with JavaHelp system features. The most 
    useful demo for this purpose is <code>idehelp</code>. This program demonstrates 
    a fully functional help system. 
  <li>Read the remainder of this chapter of the <i>JavaHelp System User's Guide</i>, 
    and explore the helpset files created for the <code>idehelp</code> demo (extract 
    the files in <code>demos\hsjar\idehelp.jar</code>). 
  <li>Create your own helpset as follows: 
    <ol>
      <li type="a">Create HTML topics using an editor of your choosing. 
      <li>Copy the metadata files you extracted from <code>demos\hsjar\idehelp.jar</code> 
        (<code>IdeHelp.hs</code>, <code>IdeHelpIndex.xml</code>, <code>IdeHelpTOC.xml</code>, 
        and <code>Map.jhm</code>) to the folder that contains your topic files 
        and rename them appropriately. 
      <li>Edit the metadata files to match your help information. 
      <li>Optionally create a full-text search database.
      <li>Use the <a href="viewing.html"><code>hsviewer</code></a> command to 
        display your helpset. 
    </ol>
</ol>
