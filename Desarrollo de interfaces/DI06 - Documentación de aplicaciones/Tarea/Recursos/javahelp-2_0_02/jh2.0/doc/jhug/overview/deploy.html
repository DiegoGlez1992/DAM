<h2><b>Deploying and Presenting JavaHelp Helpsets</b></h2>
<p> The JavaHelp system is designed to be deployed in a number of different types 
  of applications and in a variety of different network environments. The following 
  scenarios illustrate some of the different ways that the JavaHelp system can 
  be used to present and deploy information. 
<h3>Standalone Application</h3>
<p> A standalone Java application runs independently of a web browser. In this 
  scenario the Java application runs locally and accesses help data installed 
  on the same machine. 
<p align="center">
<img alt="Stand Alone App" src="../../images/standalone_scenario.gif" width="426" height="327">
</p>
<p>
The application:
<ol>
  <li>Requests the creation of a <code>JavaHelp</code> instance.</li>
  <li>Loads the help data in that instance.</li>
  <li>Presents the requested help topic.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Network Application</h3>
<p> The JavaHelp system enables an application to transparently load help data 
  from networks (intranet and Internet). When the help data is accessed across 
  a network, the scenario is essentially the same as in the standalone scenario 
  - the location of the data is transparent to the application. </p>
  <p align="center"><img alt="Network App" src="../../images/stand_net_scenario.gif" width="426" height="327"> 
</p>
<p>
The application:
<ol>
<li>Requests the creation of a <code>JavaHelp</code> instance</li>
<li>Loads the help data from the network</li>
<li>Presents the requested help topic</li>
</ol>

<h3>Embedded Help</h3>
<p>
Both navigational and content information can be embedded
directly in application windows.  Embedding is accomplished by
adding the JFC components that implement JavaHelp system
components directly into the application frame.
<p align="center">
<img alt="Embedded2" src="../../images/embedded_scenario.gif" width="426" height="326">
</p>
<p>
In this illustration, the content viewer is embedded along
the bottom of the application window, and the navigation
viewer is embedded in a different portion of the window.
<p>
The application can directly control the contents of the
content viewer by programmatic means. Likewise, JavaHelp
system navigators can be used to control information
displays other than the JavaHelp system content viewer.

<h3>Component Help</h3>
<p>
Many modern applications are composed of a collection of
interacting components.  Examples range from large
applications like Netscape Navigator<sup><font
size="-2">TM</font></sup> (with plugins), to applications
where JavaBeans components are connected together using
JavaScript<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> or Visual
Basic<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup>.  
<p>
In the case of
JavaBeans, each component can be shipped with its own help
data.  The following illustrates such a case.
<p align="center">
<img alt="Component Help" src="../../images/beans_scenario.gif" width="426" height="327">
</p>
<p>
In this case, the help information from the red JavaBean (Bean1)
and from the green JavaBean (Bean2) is merged in the help viewer
table of contents.  The merge operation can be performed by
the developer ahead of time, or completed when the
application or JavaBeans component is installed by the user.
<p> In version 1 of the JavaHelp software, merging is accomplished by appending 
  TOC and index information and searching merged full-text search databases. 
<h3>Help Server</h3>
<p>
In some environments, it is useful to separate the process
that presents the help information from the application. For
example:
<ul type="circle">
<li>Applications that are written in a language other
than the Java language (for example, C, C++, Visual Basic)
can use the JavaHelp system to display online help 
when deployed on diverse computing platforms.
<li>A suite of applications might be
installed together or separately.  In this case
the help server can be used to display help for the
entire suite, rather than each of the constituent
applications providing their own help system.
</ul>
<p>
In the following scenario, applications not written in the
Java language make requests to a JavaHelp system process
(help server) through an RPC mechanism (the RPC might be
wrapped in a library and be invisible to the application
developer).
<p align="center">
<img alt="Help Server" src="../../images/server_scenario.gif" width="428" height="327">
</p>

<h3>Browser-Based Applications (Applets)</h3>
<p>
Applications that run in browsers have a number of
unique deployment issues that the JavaHelp system
addresses.  The following three scenarios illustrate
how the JavaHelp system can be used in three of the
most common cases. 
In the following scenarios
an applet or some other triggering entity on an HTML page
requests the JavaHelp system to display help information.

<h4>Applet(1)</h4>
<p> In the first scenario, the browser contains a customized implementation of 
  the JavaHelp system and an appropriate version of the JRE (Java Runtime Environment). 
  This JRE might have been delivered with the browser, or it might have been downloaded 
  by the client into the <code>CLASSPATH</code>. The implementation can use the 
  JavaHelp system content pane, or it can use the HTML viewer that is part of 
  the web browser. 
<p align="center">
<img alt="Web Pages1" src="../../images/applet_scenario.gif" width="426" height="327">
</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>The HTML page that contains the applet tag is loaded
into the browser.
</li><li>The applet is downloaded from the server and executed.
</li><li>The user requests help.
</li><li>The applet forwards the request to the JavaHelp
system.
</li><li>Help data is downloaded from the server and displayed
in the JavaHelp system viewer (or browser window).
</li>
</ol> 

<h4>Applet(2)</h4>
<p> In the second scenario, the JavaHelp system classes are downloaded along with 
  the applet. Because the JavaHelp system is an optional package of the Java release, 
  it is possible that a fully compliant Java<sup><font size="1">TM</font></sup> 
  2 SDK browser might not have the the JavaHelp system classes in its <code>CLASSPATH</code>. 
  In this case the JavaHelp system classes must be downloaded from the server. 
  Since the JavaHelp system is quite small, this approach is often practical. 
  Browsers might provide additional means for installing extensions downloaded 
  through this mechanism. 
<p align="center">
<img alt="Web Pages2" src="../../images/download_scenario.gif" width="427" height="327">
</p>

<ol>
<li>The HTML page that contains the applet tag is loaded
into the browser.
<li>The applet is downloaded from the server and executed.
</li><li>JavaHelp system classes are downloaded from the server.
</li><li>The user requests help.
</li><li>The applet forwards the request to the JavaHelp
system.
</li><li>Help data is downloaded from the server and displayed
in the JavaHelp system viewer (or browser window).
</li>
</ol> 

<h4>Applet(3)</h4>
<p>
The third scenario describes the case in which the
applet is downloaded to a browser environment that has
neither the appropriate JRE nor the Javahelp system installed.
<p>
In this case, the Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup>
Plug-in can be used to download the required JRE and the
JavaHelp system standard extension classes.  The Java
Plug-in allows developers to specify a specific JRE on the
HTML page that is required to run their applet.  If the
correct JRE is not present on the user's system, the Java
Plug-in software downloads the correct JRE and installs it
on the user's system.  The new JRE is subsequently
available to any applet that requires it.  Because the
JavaHelp system is a standard extension to the Java
platform, the JavaHelp system classes can be downloaded
along with the JRE.
<p align="center">
<img alt="Web Pages2" src="../../images/activator_scenario.gif" width="425" height="327">
</p>

<ol>
  <li>The HTML page that contains the applet tag is loaded into the browser </li>
  <li>The Java Plug-in is downloaded. It prompts user to download appropriate 
    JRE and JavaHelp system classes. </li>
  <li>JRE and JavaHelp system classes are downloaded from the server. </li>
  <li>Java Plug-in starts the JRE. </li>
  <li>The applet is downloaded from the server and executed. </li>
  <li>The user requests help. </li>
  <li>The applet forwards the request to the JavaHelp system. </li>
  <li>Help data is downloaded from the server and displayed in the JavaHelp system 
    viewer (or browser window). </li>
</ol>
<h2>Server-based JavaHelp Helpsets</h2>
<p> By combining the JavaHelp software API with new JavaHelp JSP tag libraries, 
  web developers are now able to provide help for server-based applications that 
  provide HTML pages to a browser. The diagram below illustrates the architecture. 
<p align="center"><img src="../images/serverarch.gif" width="454" height="203">.</p>
<p align="left">A browser initiates a JSP request. Examples of a JSP request are 
  displaying the help content in the helpset, the navigators, or the data for 
  a given navigator. Typically, the JSP request contains JavaBeans<sup>TM</sup> 
  components as well as JSP tag extensions. The Java<sup>TM</sup> server turns 
  the request into a Java Servlet. The servlet access the appropriate information 
  from the helpset by using the classes in the JavaHelp library (<code>jh.jar</code>) 
  and the JavaHelp tag library (<code>jhtags.jar</code>) and returns HTML and possibly 
  JavaScript or dynamic HTML (DHTML) to the browser.</p>
