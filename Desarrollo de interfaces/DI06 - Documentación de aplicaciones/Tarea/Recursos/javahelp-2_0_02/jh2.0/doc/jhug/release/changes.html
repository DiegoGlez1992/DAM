<h2>New Features and Changes in JavaHelp 2.0</h2>
<p>
This page describes the most significant changes since the
JavaHelp 1.1.3 release. 
<h3><b>Native Browser Support</b></h3>
<p> Release 2.0_02 enables you to use a native browser to display 
  your help topics in the topic pane of the help window. This 
  alternate content viewer uses the Java Desktop Integrated Component 
  (JDIC) browser component <tt>BasicNativeContentViewerUI</tt> 
  to render content by using the native browser. The use of <tt>BasicNativeContentViewerUI</tt> 
  requires that the JDIC libraries be installed. See <a href="http://jdic.dev.java.net">http://jdic.dev.java.net</a> 
  for details on how to integrate the JDIC components into your 
  application.</p>
<p>In your applications, you use this browser by adding the following 
  import statement and then putting the call to <tt>setContentViewerUI</tt> 
  before the code that creates the <tt>HelpBroker</tt> or <tt>JHelp</tt> 
  component (for a code example that creates a <tt>HelpBroker</tt>, 
  see <a href="../dev/basics.html">Adding the JavaHelp System 
  to Applications</a>).</p>
<pre>import javax.help.SwingHelpUtilities;
...
SwingHelpUtilities.setContentViewerUI(&quot;BasicNativeContentViewerUI&quot;);</pre>
<p>Additionally, you can use the command-line parameters <tt>-ID</tt> 
  and -<tt>contentViewer</tt> to cause hsviewer to use the alternate 
  browser and display a given ID in the helpset, as follows:</p>
<p> <tt>java -jar hsviewer.jar -helpset HolidayHistory -classpath\<br>
  ../hsjar/holidays.jar -ID easter -contentViewer BasicNativeContentViewerUI</tt> 
</p>
<h3><b>Installation Packages </b></h3>
<p> JavaHelp is now released in a single zip file installation package. You must 
  uninstall prior releases before unpacking V2.0 into a directory. </p>
<h3><b>Running the JavaHelp Viewer</b></h3>
<p> The JavaHelp viewer is now in the JAR file <code>hsviewer.jar</code>. To run it 
  you must use a command similar to the following one:</p>
<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;java -jar c:\jh20\demos\bin\hsviewer.jar</code></p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="../author/viewing.html">Viewing Helpsets</a>.</p>
<h3>JDK 1.1 is no longer supported </h3>
<p>The earliest version of the JDK that is supported is the Java<font size="1"><sup>TM</sup></font> 
  2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE<font size="1"><sup>TM</sup></font>) JDK 1.2.2. 
  </p>
<h3>Change to API for Accessing Frames</h3>
<p> In previous versions of JavaHelp, you could directly access the frame in which 
  JavaHelp is displayed if you extended the DefaultHelpBroker. After extending 
  DefaultHelpBroker, you were able access the protected JFrame frame field. 
<p>In JavaHelp 2, the frame field is no longer accessible. In applications that 
  use JavaHelp 2, you will have to rewrite code that does this kind of frame access. 
  Use the following methods: 
<blockquote> 
  <p> <code>WindowPresentation DefaultHelpBroker.getWindowPresentation(); <br>
    Window WindowPresentation.getHelpWindow();</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You will still be able to access the frame with the following method calls:</p>
<blockquote> <code>WindowPresentation pres = hb.getWindowPresentation(); <br>
  Window win = pres.getHelpWindow();</code></blockquote>
<h3><a name="multipgprnt">Multi-Topic Printing</a></h3>
<p>It is now possible to print more than one help page at a time. You can select 
  a group of topics in a navigation pane, such as the TOC or index, and then choose 
  the Print option to print them all out.</p>
<h3><b>Comprehensive Merging Options</b> </h3>
<p> When helpsets are merged, there are new merge options available: UniteAppendMerge 
  and SortMerge. UniteAppendMerge causes like items to be merged, making it possible, 
  for example, to produce fully merged TOCs. SortMerge allows you to produce fully 
  merged and canonically sorted indexes. For more information, see <a href="../author/merge.html">Merging 
  Helpsets</a>. 
<h3>New Views in Help Viewer </h3>
<p>In addition to the existing
TOC, Index, and Search navigators, there are two new navigators  that can be added to the navigation pane of the help viewer:</p>
<ul type="circle">
  <li><b><a href="../author/glossary.html">Glossary</a></b>. Short technical descriptions 
    of terms can be put in an XML-based file with a format similar to the index 
    file.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b><a href="../author/favorites.html">Favorites</a></b>. An XML-based collapsible 
    and expandable display of the user's favorite topics.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Specifying View (Navigator) Icons or Text</h3>
<p>When you specify a navigator by using the <code>&lt;view&gt;</code> tag in 
  the helpset file, you can also specify the icon that displays in the tab above 
  the navigator by using the <tt>&lt;image&gt;</tt> tag. For more information 
  on setting view images, see the description of the <code>&lt;view&gt;</code> 
  tags in <a href="../author/helpset.html#viewtags">The Helpset File</a>.</p>
<p>You can display text instead of icons in the navigator tabs by setting the 
  presentation tag's <code>displayviewimage</code> attribute to <code>&quot;false&quot;</code>. 
  For more information on setting this attribute, see the description of the <code>&lt;presentation&gt;</code> 
  tag in <a href="../author/helpset.html#presentationtag">The Helpset File</a>.</p>
<h3>Presentation Controls </h3>
<p>It is now possible to display help in various kinds of windows (called <i>presentations</i>) 
  from a Java application or from a helpset's table of contents. There are presentation 
  controls in the helpset file and navigator files, a <code>Presentation</code> 
  class, and context-sensitive help changes that support the class. These features 
  provide you with more options for displaying your help content in the JavaHelp 
  Viewer, in a secondary window, or in a popup window. 
<p>Not only can you specify the type of presentation window, but for each type 
  of window you can designate the buttons that appear in the toolbar. In addition 
  to the standard Back, Forward, and Print buttons, you can display buttons like 
  the Reload button (reloads the current topic) and the Home button (goes to the 
  main topic defined for the helpset). 
<p>For more information, see the Presentation feature in <a href="../author/helpset.html#presentationtag">Helpset 
  File</a> and <a href="../dev/csh.html#presentation">Implementing Context-Sensitive 
  Help</a>. 
<h3>Customizable Toolbar Support in Helpset File </h3>
<p>When you define a presentation window, you can specify if it has a toolbar, 
  and, if so, which controls appear on the toolbar. For more information, see 
  the <code>&lt;toolbar</code>&gt; tag in <a href="../author/helpset.html#toolbar">Helpset 
  File</a>. 
<h3>Server-Based JavaHelp </h3>
<p> The JavaHelp V1.0 API provided an initial foundation for developing online 
  help for server-based applications. JavaHelp 2 extends support for server-based 
  applications with a standard for a JavaHelp bean and a Java Server Pages<sup>TM</sup> 
  (JSP) tag library for accessing helpset data. For more information, see <a href="../dev/serverhlp.html">Server-Based 
  JavaHelp</a>. 
<h3>Helpset File has an Implementation Section
</h3>
<p>The implementation section of the helpset, enclosed in the <code>&lt;impl&gt;</code> 
  tag, enables you to use special viewers based on a MIME type. It can also simplify 
  using an external browser to display your helpsets rather than using the default 
  helpset viewer included in the JavaHelp system. 
<p>Specifying an <code>&lt;impl&gt; </code>section in a helpset file creates a registry 
  that provides key data mapping to define the HelpBroker class to use in the 
  <code>HelpSet.createHelpBroker</code> method. The registry also determines the content 
  viewer to user for a given MIME type.
<p><code>JEditorPane</code> uses this mechanism to link a given MIME type with an 
  editor kit. 
<p>For example, the JavaHelp system gets its default content pane viewer for HTML 
  by linking the <code>text/html</code> MIME type to <code>com.sun.java.help.impl.CustomKit</code>, 
  which is an extension of the Swing <code>HTMLEditorKit</code>. If you wanted to 
  display PDF in the content pane, you could write your own PDF editor kit, and 
  then you could map the MIME type for PDF (<code>application/pdf</code>) to your 
  new editor kit. 
<p>Another use for this feature might be to replace the current <code>HTMLEditorKit</code> 
  (the content viewer) with a web browser without having to change code as you 
  do in JavaHelp 1.</p>
<p>To see how to declare the tag, see the &lt;<code>impl&gt;</code> tag in <a href="../author/helpset.html#toolbar">Helpset 
  File</a>. 
<h3>Dynamic Context-Sensitive Help for Components
</h3>
<p>You can assign help IDs based on cursor position, selection, 
  or some other mechanism inherent in an object. For more information, see <a href="../dev/csh.html">Dynamic 
  Map ID Assignment</a> in &quot;Implementing Context Sensitive Help.&quot;
