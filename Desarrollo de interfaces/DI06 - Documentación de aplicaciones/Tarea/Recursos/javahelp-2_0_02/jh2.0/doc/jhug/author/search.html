<h2>Full-Text Search</h2>
<p>
The JavaHelp system full-text search engine uses a natural
language search technology that not only retrieves
documents, but locates specific passages within those
documents where answers to queries are likely to be
found. The technology involves a conceptual indexing engine
that analyzes documents to produce an index of their
content and a query engine that uses this index to find
relevant passages in the material.
<p>
As the help author, you create the search database 
that is searched by the JavaHelp system full-text search
engine.  The process of creating the search database
is described in <a href="searchdb.html">Creating the Full-Text
Search Database</a>.

<h3>How Searching Works</h3>
<p>
To initiate a search the user enters a natural language
query in the search navigator Find text box. The results
are reported back to the user in the following display:

<p align="center">
<img  src="../images/search.gif" width="188" height="304">
</p>

<ul type="circle">
  <li>The circle in the first column indicates the <a
href=search.html#ranking>ranking</a> of the matches for that topic. The more filled-in 
    the circle is, the higher the ranking. There are five possible rankings (from 
    highest to lowest): <img src="../images/ranks.gif"
align="MIDDLE" width="90" height="24"> 
  <li>The number in the second column indicates the number of times the query 
    was matched in the listed topic. 
  <li>The text specifies the name of the topic (as specified in the topic's <code>&lt;TITLE&gt;</code> 
    tag) in which matches are found. <br>
 <br>
    <table width="95%">
      <tr valign="top"> 
        <td nowrap width="2%"><img src="../../images/hg_note.gif" width="18" height="13">&nbsp; 
        <td width="98%">To avoid confusion, ensure that the <code>&lt;TITLE&gt;</code> 
          tag corresponds to the title used in the table of contents. 
      </table>
    <p>&nbsp;
  </ul>


<h4><a name="ranking">Relaxation Ranking</a></h4>
<p>
The search engine uses a technique called <i>relaxation
ranking</i> to identify and score specific passages of
text that are likely to answer the user's query. 
The relaxation ranking algorithm compares the user's
query terms with occurrences of the same or related terms
in the help topics. The search engine attempts to find
passages in the help topics in which as many as possible of
the query terms occur in the same form and the same order.
The search engine automatically relaxes these constraints
to identify passages in which:
<ul type="circle">
<li>Not all of the terms occur
<li>The terms occur in different forms
<li>The terms occur in a different order
<li>The terms occur with intervening words
</ul>
<p>The search engine assigns appropriate penalties (that lower the ranking) to 
  the passages for these deviations from the specified query. </p>
<table width="95%">
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td nowrap width="2%"><img src="../../images/hg_note.gif" width="18" height="13">&nbsp; 
    <td width="98%">The ranking process improves as queries become more complex 
      and include more information.
  
</table>
<h4>Morphing</h4>
<p>
The JavaHelp search engine uses "morphing" technology to
find words with common roots.  For example, when the term
"build" is included in a search string, matches that
contain "built", "builder", "building", and "builds" are
returned.
