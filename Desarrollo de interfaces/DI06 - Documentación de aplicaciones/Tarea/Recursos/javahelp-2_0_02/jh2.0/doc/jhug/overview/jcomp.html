<h2>JavaHelp System Lightweight Components</h2>
<p> Lightweight components can add functionality to help topics. They are similar 
  to Java applets, but load and execute more quickly. 
<p> A help author can use a lightweight component that is already implemented 
  in the JavaHelp system. This component implements popup windows and secondary 
  windows. To use this lightweight component in an HTML topic file, you use the 
  HTML <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> tag as described in <a href="../author/popup.html">Calling 
  Popup and Secondary Windows From an HTML Topic</a>. 
<p>In addition, it is possible to call popup and secondary windows from Java programs 
  and from the TOC and index views of the JavaHelp viewer. For more information 
  on this technique, see Opening Popup and Secondary Windows with the Presentation 
  Manager.
<p> A Java developer can create new lightweight components as well. For example, 
  a such a component might add functionality like animation and multimedia to 
  help topics. The Java<sup><font size="1">TM</font></sup> 2 Platform includes 
  high quality audio as well as a video viewer that supports the common formats. 
  For more information see <a
href="../dev/lwcomp.html">Creating Lightweight Components</a>. </p>
