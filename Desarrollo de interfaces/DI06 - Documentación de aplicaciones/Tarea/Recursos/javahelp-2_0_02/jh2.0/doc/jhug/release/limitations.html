<h2>Limitations and Bugs</h2>
<p>This release of JavaHelp has the following limitations and bugs.</p>
<h3><a name="htmlviewer">HTML Viewer</a></h3>
<p> The JavaHelp HTML viewer is based on the Swing JEditorPane component. HTML 
  rendering can differ depending on which version of Swing your application uses. 
  Differences between versions are noted below. 
<h4>Images Distorted</h4>
<p>
Occasionally, images are distorted (stretched).
Redisplaying the page corrects the problem.
<p> You can sometimes avoid this problem by explicitly specifying "height" and 
  "width" attributes with the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag. For example, 
<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;img src=&quot;../../images/hg_note.gif&quot; width=&quot;18&quot; 
  height=&quot;13&quot;&gt;</code>
<h4><a name="classpathlimitations">Classpath Limitations</a></h4>
<p> Due to Java security protocols, it is not possible to reference images and 
  files from your topics that are outside the <code>CLASSPATH</code> of your application 
  (or <code>hsviewer</code>). </p>
<p>For example, you start <code>hsviewer</code> with the following command: </p>
<p><code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;java -jar c:\JavaHelp\demos\bin\hsviewer.jar -helpset 
  C:\my_app\help\myhelpset.hs </code></p>
<p> The <code>hsviewer</code> application sets the <code>CLASSPATH</code> to be:</p>
<p><code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C:\my_app\help </code></p>
<p>You cannot reference files above the <code>C:\my_app\help</code> folder. For example, 
  in the following code an image in <code>C:\my_app\images</code> referenced as follows 
  cannot be displayed:
<p>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;IMG SRC="../../images/foo.gif"&gt;
</code></p>
<p> You can work around this problem by using the <code>-classpath</code> parameter 
  of <code>hsviewer.jar</code>. The parameter allows you to specify a <code>CLASSPATH</code> 
  separately from the helpset file, enabling you to set the <code>CLASSPATH</code> 
  to include the folder that contains the image and specify the helpset file relative 
  to that folder. For example, you could enter the following command (all on one 
  line) at the command line:</p>
<pre>    java -jar c:\JavaHelp\demos\bin\hsviewer.jar -helpset C:\my_app\help\myhelpset.hs 
    -classpath C:\my_app</pre>
<h4>Duplicate Lines Displayed (J2SE 1.2.2) </h4>
<p> If a TOC, or index entry points to an anchor target specified at or near the 
  top of the page (in the first scroll zone), the viewer can position the lines 
  incorrectly, resulting in lines' being displayed twice. 
<h4>Anchor Targets</h4>
<p>There are two problems with anchors:</p>
<ul type="circle">
  <li>On J2SE 1.2.2 systems only, if the TOC or index is used to access a topic 
    file that contains anchor targets in the first scroll zone in the viewer, 
    text will be duplicated in the display. </li>
  <li> Named anchors cause a space to be added at the beginning of the object 
    that follows them. 
</ul>

<p> The best way to work around this problem is to nest the text of the target 
  within the anchor tag. For example: </p>
<p><code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;H2&gt;&lt;a name="widgets"&gt;Working With Widgets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H2&gt; 
  </code></p>
<h4>Cascading Style Sheets</h4>
<p> Tag names in styles and style sheets <i>must</i> be specified with lowercase 
  letters or they will be ignored. 
<h4><tt>&lt;sup&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;sub&gt;</tt> Tags (J2SE 1.2.2) </h4>
<p> The <code>&lt;sup&gt;</code> <code>&lt;sub&gt;</code> tags are ignored on J2SE 1.2.2 
  systems. 
<h4>The Width Attribute of the <tt>&lt;td&gt;</tt> Tag</h4>
<p> The width attribute of the &lt;td&gt; tag is ignored in J2SE 1.2. That version 
  of the viewer assigns its own width to table columns. 
<p> On J2SE 1.2.2, the width attribute works when specified in absolute pixels 
  (px). The use of percentages (%) is not supported in that version of J2SE. 
<h4>Named Anchors in Ordered and Unordered Lists</h4>
<p> If the first item after a list tag (<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>, 
  or <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code>) is a named anchor (<code>&lt;a name&gt;</code>), the list 
  shown in the following example is rendered incorrectly: 
<pre>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;a name="17539"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Transmitter reports
  &lt;a name="17540"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Channel reports
&lt;/ul&gt;</pre>
The following list is rendered correctly: 
<pre>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a name="17539"&gt;Transmitter reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a name="17540"&gt;Channel reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</pre>

<h4>TABS in <tt>&lt;pre&gt;</tt> Tag not Recognized</h4>
<p> TABS used in text enclosed in <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tags are not recognized. 
  Space characters are recognized correctly. 
<h4>Viewer Cannot Load Image Files Directly</h4>
<p> The help viewer aborts if you attempt to load a graphic file (*.gif, *.jpg) 
  directly. You must include the images in an HTML file by using the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> 
  tag. 
<h4>Page Setup Settings not Preserved (Printing)</h4>
<p>
Changes made to the default settings in the Page Setup dialog
box are not preserved between activations.  The default settings
are always set upon activation.

<h3>Full-text Search</h3>
<p>The text search feature, implemented by running <code>jhindexer</code> on your helpset, has the following limitations and bugs.</p>
<h4>Parsing of Asian Languages</h4>
<p>
The J2SE word-break iterator that the JavaHelp search
indexer and search navigator use to parse Asian (Japanese,
Chinese, Korean, Thai) languages uses a heuristic that is
not well suited to searching.  As a result, topic files are
not parsed into words that users are likely to enter into
the Find input field.  
<p> However, because the parser works on the same model used to highlight words 
  when the user double-clicks in the content pane, as a workaround (albeit an 
  inconvenient one), the Asian language user can conduct a full-text search as 
  follows: 
<ol>
  <li>Double-click a word in the content pane.
  <li>Copy and paste the word into the search navigator Find field.
  <li>Press Return.
</ol>

<h4>Match Limit</h4>
<p>
To enhance full-text search performance, the
search navigator  reports the 100 most relevant matches.
For example, in the <code>idedemo</code> program, if you search for the
word "build", you see that different forms of the
word (builder, built, builds) are not highlighted because
the 100 match limit was met with the exact match "build". 
This limit should not be a problem with more complex, multi-word, natural
language queries.


<h4>jhindexer Does Not Parse <tt>"."</tt> Correctly</h4>
<p> The <code>jhindexer</code> does not treat the <code>"."</code> character correctly. 
  As as result, a search for <code>"javax.help"</code> in the <code>apiviewer</code> 
  returns no matches.</p>
<h3>Context Sensitive Help</h3>
<!-- 
<h4>Field-Level Help Button</h4>
<p>
In the idedemo, if the field-level help button is clicked before the help
viewer has been accessed (for example, Help &gt; Demo JDE Help), a
NullPointerException occurs. -->
<h4>F1 Help (Solaris OpenWindows) </h4>
<p>
On Solaris OpenWindows manager the F1 key does not get help
on the the component with focus.
</p>

<h3>Other Bugs</h3>
<h4>Copy/Paste on Solaris</h4>
<p>
On Solaris systems, follow these steps to copy and paste text from the help viewer:
<ol>
  <li>Highlight text in the viewer.
  <li>Type Control-C to copy the text. 
  <li>With focus in the target Solaris window, press the Paste key. 
</ol>

<h4><tt>jar:</tt> Protocol</h4>
<p> Due to a bug, the Java<sup><font size="1">TM</font></sup> 2 SDK <code>jar:</code> 
  protocol does not permit relative references to JAR files. Instead, they must 
  be fully qualified. For example, the following code works correctly: 
<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jar:file://c:/my_app/help.jar!map.jhm</code> 
<p>There is no way to make that reference relative from the location of a helpset 
  file. For that reason, you must include the helpset and map files in the JAR 
  file with the rest of the helpset. 
<h4>Index Navigator</h4>
<p>
If an index entry contains more that two hierarchical levels,
a "turner" mechanism (like the one used in the TOC) is
added to the second +<i>n</i> levels.

<h4>Popup Window Accessibility</h4>
<p> JavaHelp popup windows are not as accessible as they should be due to a bug 
  in the underlying AWT classes that prevents the popups from obtaining focus. 
  Popup windows can be dismissed by pressing the F10 key - the Esc key does not 
  work because the window cannot obtain focus. In addition, this same bug prevents 
  scrollbars in popup windows from being accessible from the keyboard; therefore, 
  it is important to set the size of popups to enable all the information to be 
  displayed in a single scroll zone. 
<h4>Fonts and Localization</h4>
<p> There are limitations in this release on the ability to display fonts in the 
  help viewer content pane. Due to a bug in the J2SE, the only character encoding 
  that can be displayed in the HTML content pane is the system default. Different 
  locales that use that encoding are rendered correctly. `
