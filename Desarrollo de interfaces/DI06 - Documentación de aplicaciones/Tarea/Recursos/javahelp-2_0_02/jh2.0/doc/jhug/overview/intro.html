<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Most interactive applications require online help and  Java
applications are no exception. The JavaHelp<font size="1"><sup>TM</sup></font> system is
specifically tailored to the
Java<font size="1"><sup>TM</sup></font> platform.  The JavaHelp
system provides developers and authors a standard,
fully-featured, easy-to-use system for presenting online
information to Java application users. Providing a help
system that is a standard
extension to the Java<font size="1"><sup>TM</sup></font> 2 Software Development Kit, Standard Edition (the J2SE<font size="1"><sup>TM</sup></font> SDK),
relieves developers and authors of having to implement
their own proprietary help systems.
<p>
The JavaHelp system consists of a fully featured, 
extensible specification and API, and a reference implementation of that
specification and API that is written entirely in the Java language.  
<ul type="circle">
<li>The
JavaHelp reference implementation, based on the Java Foundation Classes (JFC, also known as <i>Swing</i>),
provides a  standard interface that enables both application
developers and authors to  add online
help to their applications. </li>
<li>The specification and API enable
developers to  customize and extend the help
system to fit the style and requirements of their
applications.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition,
the JavaHelp system has been designed to work especially
well in a variety of network environments.  The JavaHelp
system is platform independent and works in all browsers
that support the Java platform.
<p>
The JavaHelp system enables Java developers to
provide online help for:
<ul type="circle">
  <li>Applications (both applet and standalone) </li>
  <li>JavaBeans<sup><font size="1">TM</font></sup> components </li>
  <li>Applets in HTML pages </li>
  <li>Server-based Java applications</li>
</ul>
<p> Authoring support for the JavaHelp system is available through online help 
  authoring tool vendors. Tool vendors, including <a href="http://www.software7.biz/">Software 
  7</a>, <a href="http://www.quadralay.com/">Quadralay</a>, <a href="http://www.ehelp.com/">eHelp</a>,
