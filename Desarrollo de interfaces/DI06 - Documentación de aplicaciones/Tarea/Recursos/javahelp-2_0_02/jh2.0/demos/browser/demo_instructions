			DEMO INSTRUCTIONS

This is a demonstration of the JavaHelp viewer running in a web
browser using the Java Plug-in with JDK1.1.6 or later (does not
work with JDK1.2).

JavaHelp does not run correctly in web browsers and the
appletviewer due to a limitation in Swing 1.1 Beta3.  This
limitation will be corrected by Swing1.1FCS. In the
meantime, a description of how to work around this issue
will be posted to the JavaHelp website.

You can download JRE/JDK 1.1.7 from
http://java.sun.com/products/jdk.  It's best to install the JRE
before you proceed with the rest of these instructions.

These instructions assume that the demos\browser folder is
your current folder.

1. In order to reduce download size the Holidays HelpSet used
   in the demo is not included the browser folder. To include the
   HelpSet files in browser folder use the jar command:
	  
	(Win32)   jar -xvf ..\hsjar\holidays.jar 	

	(Solaris) jar -xvf ../hsjar/holidays.jar 

2. Copy jh.jar to the browser folder with following command:

	(Win32)   copy ..\..\javahelp\lib\jh.jar .

	(Solaris) cp ../../javahelp/lib/jh.jar .

3. Copy the version of Swing included in the JavaHelp release to the
   lib folder of the JRE or JDK.  You must use THIS version of
   Swing for the demo to work. :

	(Win32)   copy ..\..\swing\swingall.jar {JRE}\lib

	(Solaris) cp ../../swing/swingall.jar {JRE}/lib

   NOTE: Be sure that this is the same JRE/JDK to which the Java
         Plug-in points (see step 6 below).

4. Load the demo page:

	PluginDemo.html

   into either Netscape Navigator 4 or Internet Explorer 4.

5. If you do not have the Java Plug-in installed on your system,
   you will be prompted to do so and led through the automated
   process of installing it.  Note that you may have to use the
   Advanced tab on the Plug-in ControlPanel to set the correct path
   to your JRE.

6. When the page is loaded, press the Help button to start the
   JavaHelp viewer.
