<H1>Adding HelpSets</H1>
Use the Add dialog box to add HelpSets to the Merged HelpSets panel
in the main merge demo window.
<p>
In order to add a HelpSet, the folder or JAR file that
contains it must be in your CLASSPATH.  If you are
running this demo under JDK1.2, you can add to the
CLASSPATH by specifying a URL.
<p>
If you are running this demo on JDK 1.1 you can only add
the HolidayHistory.hs HelpSet to the list.  With JDK 1.1,
it is not possible to append to the CLASSPATH.  The folder
for HolidayHistory.hs has been added to the CLASSPATH by the
merge demo program.
<p>
<IMG SRC="images/hg_proc.gif">To add a HelpSet to the Merged HelpSets list
(JDK 1.2 only):
<ol>
<li>Enter the name of the HelpSet in the HelpSet Name text
box. 
<p>
<p>
The following HelpSets are included in this release:
<pre>
doc\welcome\welcome.hs
demos\hs\holidays\HolidayHistory.hs
demos\hs\idehelp\IdeHelp.hs
</pre>
You can also add HelpSets of your own.
<p>
<li>Enter the URL of the folder or JAR file that contains the HelpSet.
<em>If you are specifying a folder, the URL must include
the "/" or "\" as the last character.</em>
<p>
<p>
Examples:
<pre>
file:C:\myproduct\help\ (Win32)
file:C:\myproduct\help\helpfiles.jar (Win32)
file:/myproduct/help/ (Solaris)
file:/myproduct/help/helpfiles.jar (Solaris)
</pre>
<p>
<li>Click Add

</ol>

<p>
NOTES:
<ul>
<li>The Current Values portion of the dialog box displays
the folders and JAR files available through CLASSPATH and
URLs.
</ul>
