<h1>
Using the Merge Demo</h1>
<p>This merge demo is included to demonstrate the merge capabilities of  JavaHelp.
</p>
<h2>
How Merging Works</h2>
When helpsets are merged there is allways a <i>master </i>helpset into
which other helpsets are merged. Constituent helpsets can be dynamically
removed from the merged helpset, even while the merged helpset is displayed.
<p>In addition, a helpset file can use the <tt>&lt;subhelpset></tt> tag
to statically include helpsets. This behavior has same result as if you had added the
subhelpset to the enclosing helpset, except that if the subhelpsetfile
does not exist, it is ignored.
&nbsp;
<h2>
The Demo Program</h2>
This demo enables you to add helpsets to the <i>master </i>helpset<i>,</i>
remove constituent helpsets from the merged helpset, and display <i>master</i>
and <i>slave </i>views. The View command shows <i>master </i>and <i>slave </i>navigators, enabling you to see each helpset as it existed before the merge. The views are updated each time you merge or delete  a helpset.
<p><img src="hg_proc.gif" >Running the merge demo
<ul>
<li>
When you run the merge demo without parameters, <tt> Animals.hs</tt> is used as the <i>master </i>helpset.</li>
<li>
To merge a helpset, choose <a href="../../../../java/jh1.1/demos/hs/merge/master/add.html">Add</a>&nbsp;
from the helpset menu,  and then choose the helpset that you want to merge into the <i>master
</i>helpset</li>
<li>
To see the helpsets as they existed before the merge, choose <a href="../../../../java/jh1.1/demos/hs/merge/master/view.html">View</a>
to show the  <i>master </i>and <i>slave</i> views.</li>
<li>
To remove last  helpset merged, choose&nbsp;
Helpset &gt; Remove.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Notes:
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
The View command can display the master and slave view only  if at least one helpset has been merged.</li>
<li>
You can define the  master helpset by setting its <tt>.hs</tt> file as the first command-line argument
of the merge demo application startup command.</li>
