We have provided sources for some of the JavaHelp demos. These sources 
show how to program using the JavaHelp API.

The JavaHelp release ships with HelpSets and demo sources.  

HELPSETS

apidoc/
	HelpSet for JavaHelp API documentation.
	Shows extensibility of JavaHelp
	(Data is obtained using a javadoc/doclet which is not included in EA2)

browser/
	Demonstrates the JavaHelp viewer running as an applet in
	a web browser.

holidays/
	HelpSet with a history of the holidays.
	This is most useful to show JavaHelp as navigation of data

idehelp/
	HelpSet with (context-sensitive) help for the mock ide

merge/
	This is a simple helpset used in the merge example

object/
	HelpSet that contains two simple JComponents embedded
	in HTML pages using the <OBJECT> tag



SOURCE EXAMPLES

classviewer/
	An API viewer tool (apiviewer).
	Uses apidoc helpset generated from a JavaHelp javadoc doclet.

idedemo/
	Mock-up of an IDE tool.
	Uses classviewer, apidoc and idehelp helpsets.

merge/
	Shows how to merge HelpSets into a master HelpSet

object/
	Demonstrates two JComponents

searchdemo/
	Shows how to use an alternate SearchEngine
	Uses the holidays HelpSet



COMPILING THE SOURCES

All of the demo sources are in directory demos/src/sunw/demo/. The helpsets 
are either in compressed and encapsulated in the directory demos/hsjar or
uncompressed in demos/hs.

To recompile the classviewer use the steps indicated below. On win32 use "\"
instead of "/" as file separator, and use "copy" instead of "cp".

			      **NOTES**
(1) The merge and idedemo program must be compiled using a 1.2fcs compiler.
(2) We do not include javac in the release.
(3) We include only a portion of the searchdemo sources.
(4) When compiling on JDK1.1 you must add jdk1.1.x/lib/classes.zip
    and ../../swing/swingall.jar to the classpath. Note that the
    pathname to the jdk1.1.x directory must be fully qualified to
    make this work.

* Setup

% mkdir demos/classes
% echo $PATH
---- be sure you are getting the right javac.
% which javap
% which java
% java -fullversion

CLASSVIEWER

* Compiling classviewer (apiviewer):

% cd demos/src
% javac -d ../classes -classpath .:../classes:../../javahelp/lib/jhall.jar sunw/demo/classviewer/*.java 
% javac -d ../classes -classpath .:../classes:../../javahelp/lib/jhall.jar sunw/demo/classviewer/plaf/basic/*.java
% javac -d ../classes -classpath .:../classes:../../javahelp/lib/jhall.jar sunw/demo/classviewer/plaf/metal/*.java
% javac -d ../classes -classpath .:../classes:../../javahelp/lib/jhall.jar sunw/demo/classviewer/plaf/motif/*.java
% javac -d ../classes -classpath .:../classes:../../javahelp/lib/jhall.jar sunw/demo/classviewer/plaf/windows/*.java


IDEDEMO

* Compiling IdeDemo and copying localization data and images:

% cd demos/src
% javac -d ../classes -classpath .:../classes:../../javahelp/lib/jhall.jar sunw/demo/idedemo/*.java
% cp sunw/demo/idedemo/IdeDemo.properties ../classes/sunw/demo/idedemo/IdeDemo.properties
% mkdir ../classes/sunw/demo/idedemo/images
% cp sunw/demo/idedemo/images/* ../classes/sunw/demo/idedemo/images

* Running IdeDemo:
(note the different directory)

% cd demos
% java -classpath classes:hsjar/apidoc.jar:hsjar/idehelp.jar:../javahelp/lib/jh.jar sunw.demo.idedemo.ApiDemo


MERGE

* Compiling Merge demo:

% cd demos/src
% javac -d ../classes -classpath .:../classes:../../javahelp/lib/jhall.jar sunw/demo/merge/*.java

* Running Merge:
(note the different directory)

% cd demos
% java -classpath classes:hs/merge:../javahelp/lib/jh.jar sunw.demo.merge.Merge


OBJECT

* Compiling Object demo:

% cd demos/src
% javac -d ../classes -classpath .:../classes:../../javahelp/lib/jhall.jar sunw/demo/object/*.java

* Running Object:
(note the different directory)

% cd demos
% java -classpath classes:hs/object:../javahelp/lib/jh.jar sunw.demo.object.Object
