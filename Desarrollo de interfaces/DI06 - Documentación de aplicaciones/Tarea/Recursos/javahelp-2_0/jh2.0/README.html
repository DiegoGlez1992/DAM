<h2><a name="ChangetoAPI">Change</a> to API for Accessing Frames</h2>
<p> In previous versions of JavaHelp, you could directly access the frame in which 
  JavaHelp is displayed if you extended the DefaultHelpBroker. After extending 
  DefaultHelpBroker, you were able access the protected JFrame frame field.
<p>In JavaHelp 2, the frame field is no longer accessible. In applications that 
  use JavaHelp 2, you will have to rewrite code that does this kind of frame access. 
  Use the following methods: 
<blockquote> 
  <p> <code>WindowPresentation DefaultHelpBroker.getWindowPresentation(); <br>
    Window WindowPresentation.getHelpWindow();</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You will still be able to access the frame with the following method calls:</p>
<blockquote> 
 <code>WindowPresentation pres = hb.getWindowPresentation(); <br>
    Window win = pres.getHelpWindow();</code>
</blockquote>

<h2><a name="FileSeparators">File</a> Separators on Win32 Platforms <b>("/" vs. "\")</b></h2>

<p> All files in the JavaHelp system are specified as URLs. The separator between 
  elements (files) in a hierarchy should be "/". In some cases "\" works on the 
  Win32 platforms; however when the files that contain these references are added 
  to JAR files or moved to different platforms, these references no longer work. 

<h2><a name="TargetAudience">Target Audience</a></h2>
JavaHelp software is intended for help authors, information architects, and software 
developers who need a framework for delivering online help and documentation. 
<h2><a name="113changes">Changes</a> Since the 1.1.3 Release</h2>

<p>Changes since the 1.1.3 release are described in the "Release Information" 
  chapter of the<i> JavaHelp System User's Guide</i>. You can view the JavaHelp 
  System User's Guide as a JavaHelp helpset by executing the UserGuide.jar file 
  in the <code>demos\bin</code> folder as described in the next section, Contents 
  of the Release.</p>
<h2><a name="contentsoftherelease">Contents of the Release</a></h2>

<p>The contents of the release are described in the "Release Information" chapter 
  of the <i>JavaHelp System User's Guide</i>. You can view the JavaHelp System 
  User's Guide by executing the UserGuide.jar file in the <code>demos\bin</code> 
  folder. </p>
<p>To execute the jar file, open a command window and change your directory to 
  the <code>demos\bin</code> folder, then enter the following command at the command 
  line:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><code>java -jar UserGuide.jar</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p> The JavaHelp System User's Guide is also included in PDF format in <code>doc\jhug\jhug.pdf</code> 
  and can be read and printed by using the Adobe Acrobat Reader program available 
  at <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html">http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html</a>. 
<h2><a name="GettingStarted"></a>Getting Started</h2>

<p>You install JavaHelp software by extracting the zip file. While most 
installations will not require any additional installation tasks, 
some installations might require that the environment variable JAVAHELP_HOME
be defined so that jhindexer and jhsearch will work correctly. You will
know that you need to set JAVAHELP_HOME if, after installation, you see 
an error from jhindexer or jhsearch indicating that the environment 
variable needs to be set.
</p>
<h2><a name="redistributable"></a>Redistributable Files</h2>
<p>The following files are redistributable. Distribution of these files is governed 
  by the Terms and Conditions of the JavaHelp Binary Code License.</p>
<table border=0 cellpadding=10>
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td> <code>javahelp/lib/jh.jar</code></td>
    <td> The standard library that includes everything needed to use the help 
      viewer and the standard navigator types (TOC, index, full-text search). 
    </td>

  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td> <code>javahelp/lib/jhall.jar</code></td>
    <td> A subset of <code>jh.jar</code> that does not include support for the 
      full-text search engine. This subset might be useful for simple help systems 
      that do not require a full-text search database or for help systems whose 
      size is important. </td>

  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td> <code>javahelp/lib/jhbasic.jar</code></td>
    <td> Includes all the JavaHelp system classes, including the tools required 
      to create a search database. </td>
