<h1>
Merge Demo</h1>
<p>This merge demo is included with the release to demonstrate the JavaHelp
system helpset merging capabilities.
&nbsp;
</p>
<h2>
Merging Rules</h2>

<p>The merging rules depend on the view's merge type. There are
four merge types in JavaHelp:</p>
<table cols=2 width="90%">
<tr valign=TOP NOSAVE>
<td valign=TOP width="5%" nowrap><b><font size="+1">Merge Type</font></b></td>
<td NOSAVE width="95%"><b><font size="+1">Description</font></b></td>
</tr>
<tr valign=TOP NOSAVE>
<td valign=TOP width="5%" nowrap><b>sort</b></td>
<td NOSAVE width="95%">Collate with existing view data according to helpset's locale
collation rules.</td>
</tr>

<tr NOSAVE>
<td valign=TOP NOSAVE width="5%" nowrap><b>append</b></td>
<td width="95%">Add to the end of the existing view data.</td>
</tr>

<tr valign=TOP NOSAVE>
<td NOSAVE width="5%" nowrap><b>unite-append&nbsp;</b></td>
<td width="95%">Unite any elements, including sub-elements, at the same level in the
merged helpset with elements, including sub-elements, that have the same name
in the initial helpset. Append remaining elements in the merged helpset
at the end of the initial helpset. Add to the end of existing view data.</td>
</tr>

<tr NOSAVE>
<td valign=TOP NOSAVE width="5%" nowrap><b>none</b></td>
<td width="95%">No merging is done. Only valid on a view.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Please read the other pages in this online help for a description of
how to run the demo.</p>
