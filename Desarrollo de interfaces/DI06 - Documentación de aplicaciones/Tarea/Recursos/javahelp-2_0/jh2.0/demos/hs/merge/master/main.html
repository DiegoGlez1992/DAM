<H1>Using the Merge Demo</H1>
This merge demo is included to demonstrate the merge
capabilities as they exist in the JavaHelp system.  

<H2>How Merging Works</H2> 
When HelpSets are merged, the TOC, index, and search
database information of the constituent HelpSets are
appended to each other to form a merged HelpSet.
Constituent HelpSets can be dynamically
removed from the merged HelpSet, even while the merged
HelpSet is displayed.
<p>
It's important to understand that
there is always a <em>master</em> HelpSet to which other
HelpSets are appended.  For the purposes of this demo, this
HelpSet serves as the master HelpSet.
<H2>The Demo Program</H2>
This demo allows you to add HelpSets to the merge list, display
the resulting merged HelpSet, and remove constituent HelpSets 
from the merged HelpSet.
<p>
<IMG SRC="images/hg_proc.gif">To run the merge demo:
<ol>
<li>Use the <A HREF="add.html">Add dialog box</A> to
construct a list of HelpSets in the Merged HelpSets panel that
you wish to append to the Master HelpSet
<li>In the list, select the Master HelpSet
<li>Click the Display button to view the merged information. 
<li>To remove one of the constituent HelpSets (other than
the Master HelpSet), select the HelpSet in the list and
click the Remove button.
</ol>
NOTES:
<ul>
<li>You can view any of the HelpSets in the list
individually by selecting them and clicking Display. To
view merged HelpSets you <em>must select the Master HelpSet
only</em>, then click Display. All the HelpSets
in the list are appended to the Master HelpSet.
