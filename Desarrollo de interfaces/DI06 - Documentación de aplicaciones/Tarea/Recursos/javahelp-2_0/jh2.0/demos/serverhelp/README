JavaHelp 2.0 Server-Based JavaHelp Demo
---------------------------------------

This demo shows the Server-Based Help feature of JavaHelp 2. It requires
two open source products developed by the Apache Software Foundation:

- Tomcat 4.0 or greater, available for download at:

     http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/

- Apache Ant, available for download at:

     http://ant.apache.org/


To build the demo:

1. Install Ant and Tomcat on your system. 

2. Open a command window or terminal window if you are not
   already working on the command line.

3. Change to the server demo directory:
 
      <jh2_install_dir>/jh2.0/demos/serverhelp

4. Execute a command with the following format:

      ant -Dcatalina.home=<jakarta_tomcat_home> all deploy

   In your command, replace <jakarta_tomcat_home> with the installed 
   home directory of Tomcat. For example, if Tomcat is installed 
   on a Windows machine in C:\Program Files\Tomcat_41, and the Ant 
   installation is in your PATH, the following command should work:

      ant -Dcatalina.home="C:\Program Files\Tomcat_41" all deploy
   
   Note: The ant software is case sensistive. Be sure to enter the
   directory names exactly as you see them in the file system, 
   because ant will create new directories with different case if
   the names do not match exactly, even on a Windows system.


To run the demo:

1. Start the Tomcat server. (If you just installed the server, it 
   might already be running.)

   For example, on a Windows system, choose 
   Start > Programs > Apache Tomcat 4.1 > Start Tomcat.

   Note: On a Windows NT, 2000, or XP system, your user account must
   have administrative privileges.

2. Open a browser and enter a URL with the following format:

      http://<yoursystemname>:8080/JavaHelpDemo

   In your URL, replace <yoursystemname> with the name of your  
   computer or the name of the computer running Tomcat. For example,  
   if Tomcat is running on your local computer, the following URL
   should work:

      http://localhost:8080/JavaHelpDemo


Troubleshooting

If the URL does not work, see the Tomcat readme file for some
troubleshooting information. Here are some common problems:

- You are behind a firewall and your browser is using a proxy
  server. Turn this setting off and then try the URL again.

- The 8080 port is already being used. The Tomcat readme file 
  describes how to set a different port in Tomcat's server.xml file.

- If you successfully compiled the demo in ant, and, when you try to
  run the demo in a browser, you get a message from the Tomcat server 
  saying that it cannot find JavaHelpDemo, it is possible that the 
  <jakarta_tomcat_home> path use with the ant command had a misspelling 
  in it. If a directory name is misspelled, ant creates a new 
  directory by that name and puts JavaHelpDemo there instead of 
  storing it in the Tomcat path. You can copy the JavaHelpDemo file 
  from that directory to the <jakarta_tomcat_home>/webapps directory, 
  and then the demo should run.
