CHANGE TO API FOR ACCESSING FRAMES

In previous versions of JavaHelp, you could access the frame
in whichJavaHelp is displayed directly if you extended the 
DefaultHelpBroker. After extending DefaultHelpBroker, you 
were able access the protected JFrame frame field. 
 
In JavaHelp 2, the frame field is no longer accessible. In
applications that use JavaHelp 2, you have to rewrite code 
that does this kind of frame access. Use the following methods:

   WindowPresentation DefaultHelpBroker.getWindowPresentation(); 
   Window WindowPresentation.getHelpWindow();

You will still be able to access the frame with the following method
calls:

   WindowPresentation pres = hb.getWindowPresentation(); 
   Window win = pres.getHelpWindow();


FILE SEPARATORS FOR WIN32 PLATFORMS

All files in the JavaHelp system are specified as URLs.  The
separator between elements (files) in a hierarchy should be "/".
In some cases "\" works on the Win32 platforms; however when the
files that contain these references are added to JAR files or moved
to different platforms, these references no longer work.

TARGET AUDIENCE

JavaHelp software is intended for help authors, information
architects, and software developers who need a framework for
delivering online help and documentation. 

CHANGES SINCE THE 1.1.3 RELEASE

Changes since the 1.1.3 release are described in the "Release
Information" chapter of the JavaHelp System User's Guide.  You can
view the JavaHelp System User's Guide as a JavaHelp helpset by 
executing the UserGuide.jar file in the demos\bin folder as
described under CONTENTS OF THE RELEASE.

CONTENTS OF THE RELEASE

The contents of the release are described in the "Release Information"
Information" chapter of the JavaHelp System User's Guide.  You can
view the JavaHelp System User's Guide as a JavaHelp helpset by 
executing the UserGuide.jar file in the demos\bin folder.

To execute the jar file, open a command window and change your 
directory to the demos\bin folder, then enter the following command 
at the command line:

   java -jar UserGuide.jar

The JavaHelp System User's Guide is also included in PDF format in 
doc\jhug\jhug.pdf and can be read and printed by using the Adobe
Acrobat Reader program available at: 
http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html


GETTING STARTED

You install JavaHelp software by extracting the zip file. While most 
installations will not require any additional installation tasks, 
some installations might require that the environment variable JAVAHELP_HOME
be defined so that jhindexer and jhsearch will work correctly. You will
know that you need to set JAVAHELP_HOME if, after installation, you see 
an error from jhindexer or jhsearch indicating that the environment 
variable needs to be set.


RESDISTRIBUTABLE FILES

The following files are redistributable. Distribution of these files is 
governed by the Terms and Conditions of the JavaHelp Binary Code License.

javahelp/lib/jh.jar       - The standard library that includes everything 
                            needed to use the help viewer and the standard 
                            navigator types (TOC, index, full-text search).
 
javahelp/lib/jhall.jar    - A subset of jh.jar that does not include support
                            for the full-text search engine. This subset 
                            might be useful for simple help systems that 
                            do not require a full-text search database or 
                            for help systems whose size is important.

javahelp/lib/jhbasic.jar  - Includes all the JavaHelp system classes, 
                            including tools to create a search database. 

javahelp/lib/jhsearch.jar - The default full-text search engine used in the 
                            JavaHelp system.
