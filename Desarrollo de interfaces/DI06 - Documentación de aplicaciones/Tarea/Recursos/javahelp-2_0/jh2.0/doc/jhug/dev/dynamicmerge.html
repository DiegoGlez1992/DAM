<h2>Merging Helpsets Dynamically</h2>
<p> In addition to the static merging of helpsets described in <a href="../author/merge.html">Merging 
  Helpsets</a>, helpsets can be merged dynamically. To merge helpsets dynamically, 
  you use the JavaHelp software API in your Java applications. 
<p>
The basic API consists of the 
<code>HelpSet.add(HelpSet)</code> method
and its corresponding
<code>HelpSet.remove(HelpSet)</code>method.
These methods fire 
<code>HelpSetEvent</code> events for the
<code>HelpSetListeners</code> that have registered interest in them.
The Component UIs for the TOC, index,  search, and glossary views register for
these events and react to changes.

<p>
The semantics of merging is implemented by individual
<code>NavigatorView</code> objects
and
<code>JHelpNavigator</code> objects.
There are three basic methods:
<ul type="circle">
<li><code>canMerge(NavigatorView)</code>
<li><code>merge(NavigatorView)</code>
<li><code>remove(NavigatorView)</code>
</ul>
The <code>canMerge(NavigatorView)</code> method is present in both
<code>NavigatorView</code> and <code>JHelpNavigator</code>.
The <code>JHelpNavigator</code> method just calls into its
corresponding <code>NavigatorView</code> method.
The other two methods are present only in <code>JHelpNavigator</code>.
<p> For more information about these classes and methods, refer to the JavaHelp 
  software API documentation. API information can be viewed using a web browser 
  (<code>doc/api/overview-summary.html</code>) or by using the sample API viewer 
  in <code>demos\bin\apiviewer</code>. 
<p> Two demonstration programs, <code>demos\bin\merge</code> and <code>demos\bin\newmerge</code> 
  are included with the JavaHelp system release. These programs demonstrate how 
  helpsets can be merged and removed dynamically. The <code>newmerge</code> program 
  demonstrates what happens with a UniteAppendMerge of TOCs and a SortMerge of 
  indexes. 
<p>The sources for these programs are available under <code>demos\src\sunw\demo\</code>.
