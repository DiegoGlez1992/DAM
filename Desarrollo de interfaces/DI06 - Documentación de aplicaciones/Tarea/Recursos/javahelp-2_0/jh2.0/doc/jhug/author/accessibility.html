<h2>Accessibility and JavaHelp Viewer Shortcut Keys</h2>
<p>The JavaHelp<sup><small>TM</small></sup> system tri-pane viewer is designed 
  to be accessible. Most features in the help viewer are accessible from the keyboard. 
</p>
<p> The first time you open the help viewer, the focus should be on the default 
  entry in the TOC navigator. Sometimes you cannot tell where the focus is because 
  of a bug that can occur when the Back button is unselected. If you cannot tell 
  where the focus is, use the following procedure to establish focus again:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Press Ctrl-F1 to display alternate text for a toolbar button. This action 
    works only if the current focus is on a toolbar button.</li>
  <li>If no alternate text displays, press F6 to see if the focus moves to an 
    item in the current navigator.</li>
  <li>If the focus does not move to the navigator, press F6 once more (because 
    focus might have moved to the Content pane). Focus should now be in the Navigation 
    pane. </li>
  <li>With focus in the Navigation pane, if you want to be absolutely sure where 
    you are, you can repeatedly press Shift-Tab followed by Ctrl-F1 until alternate 
    text displays for a toolbar button.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Traversing the Viewer</h3>
<p>If the focus is in the toolbar buttons and you press the Tab key to traverse 
  through the viewer, the traversal order is as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The toolbar buttons from left to right</li>
  <li>The currently open tab in the Navigation (left)  pane</li>
  <li>The contents of that navigator
    <p>Behavior in the navigator varies depending on whether or not the navigator 
      has a Search field. It will take up to four more presses of the Tab key 
      to move to the Content pane. Pressing F6 instead will move focus directly 
      to the Content (right) pane.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The topic in the Content (right) pane</li>
</ol>
<p>When focus is in the Content pane, pressing the Tab key has no effect. The 
  Tab key does not wrap from the Content pane back to the toolbar. You can traverse 
  backwards from the Content pane by pressing F6 to move to the Navigation pane, 
  and then pressing Shift-Tab repeatedly.</p>
<h3>Traversing and Using the Toolbar Buttons</h3>
<p>You can move the focus between the toolbar buttons by pressing either the Left 
  Arrow and Right Arrow keys or the Tab and Shift-Tab keys. If you want to stay 
  in the toolbar and move from button to button, the Arrow keys are the best choice. 
  If you want to be able to move focus out of the toolbar, use the Tab and Shift-Tab 
  keys.</p>
<p>When a button has focus, you can perform two actions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pressing Spacebar activates the button (for example, activating the Print 
    button prints the currently selected topic or topics).</li>
  <li>Pressing Ctrl-F1 displays the button's alternate text.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Traversing and Using the Navigators</h3>
<p>The Navigation pane has a tabbed interface. If focus is on the last toolbar 
  button, pressing the Tab key takes you to the currently selected Navigator tab. 
  At that point, you can either press the Tab key to enter the navigator or press 
  Right Arrow or Left Arrow to select a different navigator. The behavior of the 
  focus depends on the type of navigator, as follows:</p>
<h4>TOC, Favorites, and Glossary Navigators</h4> 
    <ul>
      <li>If you use an Arrow key to move to the navigator from another Navigator 
        tab, the focus moves automatically to an entry in the navigator.</li>
      <li>If you use a Tab key to move to the navigator (for example, from a toolbar 
        button), the focus remains on the Navigator tab. If you press the Tab 
        key, the focus moves to an entry in the navigator.</li>
      <li>In the navigator list, if you want to move to the Content pane, using 
        the F6 key produces the most predictable results. The Tab key has varying 
        results depending on whether or not there are scrollbars. Pressing the 
        Tab key once changes focus to the vertical scrollbar if there is one. 
        Pressing the Tab key again changes focus to the horizontal scrollbar if 
        there is one. Pressing Tab again changes focus to the Content (right) 
        pane. If you want to move to the Content pane, pressing the F6 key produces 
        the most predictable results.</li>
      <li>In any Navigator list the following keys move focus from item to item 
        and change the corresponding topic in the Content (right) pane: 
        <ul>
          <li>The Up Arrow and Down Arrow keys move the focus from item to item 
            in the navigator. </li>
          <li>The Page Up and Page Down keys move the focus through the navigator 
            a page at a time.</li>
          <li>The Home and End keys move the focus to the beginning and end of 
            the list.</li>
          <li>The Right Arrow key opens a folder and the Left Arrow key closes 
            a folder.</li>
          <li>Ctrl-Right Arrow scrolls left and Ctrl-Left Arrow scrolls right.</li>
          <li>F8 selects the splitter bar between the Navigator pane and the Content 
            pane. With the splitter bar selected, you can move it right and left 
            with the Right Arrow and Left Arrow keys.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The F6 key changes focus to the Content pane.</li>
    </ul>

 <h4>Index and Search Navigators</h4> 
 <p>These navigators have a text field for 
    the search entry at the top of the navigator content pane, so they behave 
    differently from the other navigators. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you use an Arrow key to move to the navigator from another Navigator 
        tab, the focus moves immediately to the Search field. </li>
      <li>If you use a Tab key to move to the navigator (for example, from a toolbar 
        button), the focus remains on the Navigator tab. If you press the Tab 
        key again, the focus moves to the Search field. </li>
      <li>In the Search field, if you press the Tab key, the focus moves to the 
        navigator list.</li>
      <li>In the navigator list, if you want to move the focus to the Content 
        pane, using the F6 key produces the most predictable results. The Tab 
        key has varying results depending on whether or not there are scrollbars. 
        Pressing the Tab key once changes the focus to the vertical scrollbar 
        if there is one. Pressing the Tab key again changes the focus to the horizontal 
        scrollbar if there is one. Pressing Tab again changes the focus to the 
        Content (right) pane.</li>
      <li>In any Navigator list the following keys move the focus from item to 
        item and change the corresponding topic in the Content (right) pane: 
        <ul>
          <li>The Up Arrow and Down Arrow keys move the focus from item to item 
            in the navigator. </li>
          <li>The Page Up and Page Down keys move the focus through the navigator 
            a page at a time.</li>
          <li>The Home and End keys move the focus to the beginning and end of 
            the list.</li>
          <li>The Right Arrow key opens a folder and the Left Arrow key closes 
            a folder.</li>
          <li>Ctrl-Right Arrow scrolls left and Ctrl-Left Arrow scrolls right.</li>
          <li>F8 selects the splitter bar between the Navigator pane and the Content 
            pane. With the splitter bar selected, you can move it right and left 
            with the Right Arrow and Left Arrow keys.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The F6 key changes the focus to the Content pane.</li>
    </ul>
 
<h3>Traversing and Using the Content Pane</h3>
<p>The Content pane, on the right side of the viewer, displays the current help 
  topic. You can get to this pane by navigating to the Navigation (left)  pane and 
  pressing F6. When you are in the Content pane, you can use the following keys 
  to move around and perform actions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Right Arrow and Left Arrow move the focus left or right one letter at a 
    time. You cannot see the focus change.</li>
  <li>Ctrl-Right Arrow and Ctrl-Left Arrow move the focus left or right one word 
    at a time. You cannot see the focus change.</li>
  <li> Up Arrow and Down Arrow move the focus up and down one line at a time. 
    You cannot see the focus change. </li>
  <li> Page Up and Page Down move the the topic up and down a page at a time.</li>
  <li>Ctrl-Home and Ctrl-End move focus to the beginning and end of the topic.</li>
  <li>Ctrl-T selects the next link. Ctrl-Shift-T selects the previous link.</li>
  <li>Shift-Spacebar activates the selected link and goes to the linked topic.</li>
  <li>F8 selects the splitter bar between the Navigator pane and the Content pane. 
    With the splitter bar selected, you can move it right and left with the Right 
    Arrow and Left Arrow keys. </li>
  <li> F6 changes the focus to the Navigation (left) pane.</li>
</ul>
