<h2>Invocation Mechanisms</h2>
<p>
Users invoke online help from within applications in a
number of ways.  This section describes invocation
methods available through the JavaHelp system.

<h3>Menus and Buttons</h3>
<p>
Online help is often invoked when a user chooses an item from a Help menu or clicks on a Help button in an application GUI.
<p>
The JavaHelp system provides a simple interface by which an
application requests that a topic ID be displayed.  The
JavaHelp system then associates the topic ID with the
appropriate URL and displays it.  IDs are mapped to URLs in
a JavaHelp system metadata file called the <i>map
file</i>.
<p>
For example, when coding a file chooser dialog box, a
developer requests that the topic ID <code>fc_help</code>
be displayed when the Help button at the bottom of the
dialog box is clicked.  In the map file the ID
<code>fc_help</code> is defined to be a file named
<code>FileChooser.html</code> using the following XML syntax:
<pre>&lt;mapID target="fc_help" url="html/help/FileChooser.html" /&gt;</pre>
<p>
Separating the specification of file names (or URLs)
from the program code provides content authors the freedom
to control the information that is associated with the
topic ID.
<p>

<h3>Tooltips</h3>
<p>
A <i>tooltip</i> is a brief message presented to
the user when the cursor remains over a button for an
interval longer than a given threshold.
<p>
Although tooltip information could be included in the
JavaHelp system data, it will usually be delivered as part
of the application and will be co-located with the code.
Tooltip functionality is provided as a component in Swing.
<p>

<h3>Context-Sensitive Help</h3>
<p> The JavaHelp system provides the ability to invoke online help that describes 
  graphical components in an application GUI. The user makes gestures that activate 
  context-sensitive help and then specifies the component in question. The ID 
  associated with the component is displayed. 
<h3>Viewer Initiated Help</h3>
<p>You can display help topics from a TOC or index navigator or from the content 
  pane of the main window. By default, an index entry and a TOC entry display 
  help in the main window's content viewer. You can also define an entry that 
  displays help in a popup or a secondary window. In the content pane, you can 
  define an &lt;object&gt; tag that displays help in a separate popup or secondary 
  window. If you use a standard HTML link in the content pane, the linked help 
  topic replaces the current one in the content pane.</p>
<h3>System Initiated Context-Sensitive Help</h3>
<p>The following invocation would display system-initiated help in a main window.</p>
<pre>mainHelpBroker.setCurrentID(helpID); </pre>
