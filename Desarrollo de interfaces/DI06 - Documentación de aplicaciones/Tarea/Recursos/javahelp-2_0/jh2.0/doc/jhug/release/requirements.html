<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p> You must install the Java<sup><font size="1">TM</font></sup> 2 Platform, Standard 
  Edition SDK (J2SE SDK) to be able to use JavaHelp 2.0. 
<p>The JavaHelp 2.0 release is an optional package of the J2SE SDK (JDK 1.2.2 
  and later). As a result, it works well with all versions of the J2SE. JavaHelp 
  2.0 does not work with JDK 1.1.x. We have tested this release against J2SE 1.2.2, 
  1.3.1, and 1.4.1 on the following systems: </p>
