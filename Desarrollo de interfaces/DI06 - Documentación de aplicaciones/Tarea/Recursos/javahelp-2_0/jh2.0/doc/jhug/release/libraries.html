<h2>The JavaHelp Libraries and Tools</h2>
<p> The JavaHelp libraries and tools are located in the <code>javahelp</code> folder 
  of the release. All classes work with the Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition 
  (J2SE) and use Swing 1.2 or later (included in the J2SE). 
<h3>Libraries</h3>
<p> The JavaHelp classes are distributed in the following four JAR files located 
  in the <code>javahelp\lib</code> folder:</p>
<table border=0 cellpadding=10>
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td nowrap> <code>jh.jar</code>&nbsp; </td>
    <td> The standard library, which includes everything needed to use the standard 
      navigator types (TOC, index, full-text search). </td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td nowrap> <code>jhbasic.jar</code> </td>
    <td> A subset of <code>jh.jar</code> that does not include support for the 
      full-text search engine. This subset might be useful for very simple help 
      systems that do not require a full-text search database or for help systems 
      in which size is critical. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td nowrap> <code>jhall.jar</code> </td>
    <td> Contains all the JavaHelp system classes, including the tools required 
      to create a search database. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td nowrap> <code>jsearch.jar</code> </td>
    <td> Contains the default full-text search engine used in the JavaHelp system. 
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h3>Tools</h3>
<p> The JavaHelp tools are used to view helpsets and to build and query the full-text 
  search database. These tools are located in the <code>javahelp\bin</code> folder. 
</p>
<table border=0 cellpadding=10>
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td nowrap> <a href="../author/jhindexer.html">jhindexer</a>&nbsp; </td>
    <td> Command-line program that creates the full-text search database used 
      by the JavaHelp system full-text search navigator to locate matches. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td nowrap> <a href="../author/jhsearch.html">jhsearch</a> </td>
    <td> Command-line program that queries the JavaHelp system full-text search 
      database that is created with the <code>jhindexer</code> command. You can 
      use <code>jhsearch</code> to test a search database without invoking the 
      help viewer.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
