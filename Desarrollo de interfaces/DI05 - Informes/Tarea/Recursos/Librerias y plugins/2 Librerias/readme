JasperReports Library 6.11.0 Change Log
=============================================

- support for noData cell added in the table component to allow displaying custom content when 
there are no detail rows in the table data source;

- support for printWhenExpression added to table component sections to allow suppressing entire 
rows in the table and not only individual cells;

- isStretchWithOverflow boolean property of text fields has been deprecated and replaced by the 
new textAdjust property which adds a third option to scale down the font size in order for the 
text content to fit the design size of the text field element;

- implemented server side rendering of Javascript visualizations using the headless Google Chrome 
browser, to replace the now deprecated PhantomJS and SlimerJS based feature;

- minor bug fixes and improvements;
