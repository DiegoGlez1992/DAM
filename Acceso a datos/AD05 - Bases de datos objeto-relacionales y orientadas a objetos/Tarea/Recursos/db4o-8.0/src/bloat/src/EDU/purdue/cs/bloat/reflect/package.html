<p>Provides an abstract API for working with Java classfiles.  In this
package, names and types are represent by indices into the constant
pool.  Modifier flags, the constant pool, exception handlers, and
debugging information are also modeled directly in this package.  The
classes and interfaces in this package exist to give an opaque and
abstract view of the underlying representation of the Java class.</p>
