<p>BLOAT, the Bytecode-Level Optimizer and Analysis Tools, is a Java
classfile optimizer that is written entirely in Java.  BLOAT was
designed and developed by Nate Nystrom in 1998 and performs a number
of intraprocedural optimizations on Java bytecode:</p>

<ul>
<li>Control flow graph construction
<li>Conversion to static single assignment (SSA) form
<li>Constant and copy propagation
<li>Dead code elimination
<li>Partial redundency elimination of expressions and access paths
    (e.g. array and fieldreferences)
<li>Efficient "register" (JVM local variables) allocation
<li>Java bytecode peephole optimizations
</ul>
