<p>Repositories for important BLOAT objects such as the
<tt>Editor</tt>, <tt>ClassHierarchy</tt>, and <tt>FlowGraph</tt>s.  In
order to avoid build dependencies with other packages we took the
novel approach of having a "context" interface in several packages that
the classes in this package then implement.</p>

<p>The reason we implement all of the methods in one class is so that
if the user wants to have different contexts with different attributes
(for instance, caching policies), all one has to do is subclass
<tt>BloatContext</tt> instead of subclassing other contextes which may
become ackward.</p>
