<p>Performs type-base alias analysis (TBAA) on a control flow graph.
Type-based alias analysis considers the types of variables when
deciding whether or not two variable can refer to the same object.
Before TBAA can occur, the types of variables are inferred.  Type
inference requires information about the class hierarchy of classes
being BLOATed.</p>
