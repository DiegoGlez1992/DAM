<p>Classes to represent a Java method as a control flow graph of basic
blocks.  A <em>basic block</em> is a sequence of code that is entered
only in once place (e.g. the target of a branch statement) and is
exited at only one place (e.g. a branch statement).  Each basic block
consists of an expression tree.  There are also classes to represent
try-catch blocks, Java subroutines (<tt>finally</tt> blocks), certain
properties of the control flow graph such as its dominator tree, and
to visualize a control flow graph.</p>
