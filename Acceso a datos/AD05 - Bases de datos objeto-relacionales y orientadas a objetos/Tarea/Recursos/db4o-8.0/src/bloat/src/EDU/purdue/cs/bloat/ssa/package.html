<p>Converts a control flow graph into static single assignment (SSA)
form.  In SSA form, each variable in the method has a number
associated with it.  Each target of an assignment statement is
assigned a new number.  Subsequent uses of that variable are assigned
the same number.  Thus, we have a compact form of definition-use
information.  Many of the optimiations we do take advantage of SSA form.</p>
